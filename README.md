Jennifer Long's Python-API homework

In this repository you will find my two ipynbs - one for the WeatherPy activity and one for the VacationoPy activity. In the "output_data" folder, you will find my images from the scatter plots in the WeatherPy activity as well as the cities.csv file that was created in that notebook. In the WeatherPy notebook, you will see observations at the bottom. I have also listed those here.


Observations from WeatherPy:

    1) As you get closer to a latitude of 0, the max temperatures get higher. This is true because a latitude of 0 is the equator and the equator is closer to the sun which creates higher temperatures for that area.

    2) Most latitudes appear to have average wind speeds, but around -60 and 60 degrees latitude, you see a spike in wind speeds. This can be explained by temperature changes. The winds blowing from 30 degrees to 60 degrees in both hemispheres blow towards their respective poles. This air is warm air while the wind blowing from the poles towards the equator is cold air. When this air mixes (around the 60 degree marks on both northern and southern hemispheres), the wind speeds increase.
    
    3) Clouds vary across all latitudes as in all cities, you will see clouds at some point. Therefore there is no correlation in latitude and cloudiness.
